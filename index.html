        <h1>Who is Billie Jean King?</h1>
        <hr .>
        <code>Billie Jean King is a legendary American former professional tennis player. She&#39;s widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time and a champion for gender equality both on and off the court. Here&#39;s a more detailed breakdown of who she is:

**Key Highlights:**

*   **Tennis Legend:** She won 39 Grand Slam titles: 12 in singles, 16 in women&#39;s doubles, and 11 in mixed doubles. Some of her most notable achievements include winning Wimbledon six times in singles, four times in doubles, and three times in mixed doubles.

*   **Battle of the Sexes:** King is perhaps most famous for her 1973 exhibition match against Bobby Riggs, a former men&#39;s champion who claimed that women&#39;s tennis was inferior. King defeated Riggs in straight sets, a victory that was not only a major sporting event but also a significant cultural moment that helped advance the cause of women&#39;s sports.

*   **Advocate for Gender Equality:** Throughout her career and beyond, King has been a vocal advocate for gender equality in sports and beyond. She fought for equal prize money for women tennis players and co-founded the Women&#39;s Tennis Association (WTA) in 1973 to give women players more control over their sport.

*   **LGBTQ+ Advocate:** King publicly came out as lesbian in 1981, making her one of the first prominent athletes to do so. She has since become a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and equality.

*   **Entrepreneur and Businesswoman:** After retiring from professional tennis, King has been involved in various business ventures, including sports management and investments.

*   **Humanitarian:** She has worked with numerous charitable organizations, focusing on issues related to gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and education.

*   **Awards and Recognition:** Billie Jean King has received numerous awards and accolades for her contributions to tennis, sports, and society. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987 and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.

In short, Billie Jean King is far more than just a tennis player. She&#39;s a cultural icon, a pioneer for gender equality, and a role model for athletes and activists around the world.
