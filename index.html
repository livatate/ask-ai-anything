        <h1>Who is Billie Jean King?</h1>
        <hr .>
        <pre>Billie Jean King is an American former professional tennis player. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and she&#39;s also a pioneering advocate for gender equality in sports and beyond. Here&#39;s a summary of her significance:

*   **Tennis Legend:** King won 39 Grand Slam titles: 12 in singles, 16 in women&#39;s doubles, and 11 in mixed doubles. She was a dominant force in the sport, known for her aggressive serve-and-volley style.

*   **&#34;Battle of the Sexes&#34;:** Perhaps her most famous match was the 1973 exhibition match against Bobby Riggs, a self-proclaimed male chauvinist and former top-ranked male player. King&#39;s victory in this highly publicized event was a watershed moment for women&#39;s sports, helping to challenge stereotypes and promote the idea that women could compete at a high level.

*   **Advocate for Gender Equality:** King has been a tireless advocate for equal prize money for women in tennis and for greater opportunities for women in sports and other fields. She was instrumental in the formation of the Women&#39;s Tennis Association (WTA).

*   **LGBTQ+ Rights Advocate:** King is also a prominent voice for LGBTQ+ rights. She came out as lesbian in 1981 and has since been an outspoken advocate for equality and inclusion.

*   **Other Accomplishments:** Beyond her on-court achievements and advocacy work, King has also been involved in various business ventures, served on boards, and received numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
